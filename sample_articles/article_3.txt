Climate change is not only an environmental issue but also a profound economic challenge. Rising global temperatures and extreme weather events disrupt agriculture, damage infrastructure, and strain national economies. Economists warn that without decisive action, climate change could reduce global GDP by up to 20% by 2100.

Developing countries face the harshest impact, despite contributing the least to greenhouse gas emissions. Crop failures, floods, and heatwaves threaten food security and force migrations, deepening poverty. Meanwhile, developed nations grapple with balancing economic growth and carbon reduction commitments.

Investing in renewable energy presents a dual opportunity: it mitigates climate risks while spurring economic growth through job creation and innovation. According to the International Energy Agency, clean energy investment could add $10 trillion to the global economy by 2050.

The path forward demands a global effort — carbon pricing, green infrastructure investment, and sustainable consumption patterns. In economic terms, the cost of inaction far outweighs the investment needed for climate adaptation and mitigation.
